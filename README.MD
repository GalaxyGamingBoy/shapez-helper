# Shapez-Helper

WIP - Work In progress

This is a cli tool to help mod developers mod ShapezIO

## Why should I use this CLI Tool?

This CLI Tool has many QOL Features that you may need.  
These features include:

-   Encoding images to Base64
-   Decoding from Base64
-   And many more in the future ( Still in development )

Another reason is that you don't need to install an npm package but only the .exe file and the settings,
so it is more lightweight in the end.

Furthermore, you may want to stay closer to the original project.

### Note: This project is not made by Tobspr and isn't official
